	<p><h1 align="center">ABOUT US</h1><p><br/>

	<p><h2 align="center">Centro Books began in 2018 under the aegis of its founders, De Zoysa and sons. Over the year that have followed, we have grown to become an icon of the Sri Lankan cultural landscape, employing over 100 superb booksellers across over 80 bookshops.

	As the last surviving national bookshop chain, under the helmsmanship of Managing Director De Zoysa, we are proud to have fought off the perceived threat of e-readers and online competition to begin a programme of active expansion. Recent months have seen fresh shops open around the country and sites either move or be upgraded. With recent openings including Ragama, Kollupitiya and moves to far more attractive locations for our shops in Kiribathgoda and Kaduwela, our plans continue to be ambitious.

	Perhaps unusually for a national retailer, our branch managers enjoy a high degree of individual autonomy, running their shops to best please their local customers, with only the lightest of central suggested direction. We take enormous pleasure in championing simply good (but sometimes relatively overlooked) books, intense novel that we turned into a bestseller forty years after its original publication.

	Working closely with our bookshops are our efforts online, where at GoodBooks.lk we are working to bring the very essence of GoodBooks to every home and smartphone in Sri Lanka. With hugely popular endeavours such as our regular reading update GoodBooks Weekly and an ever-increasing offering of exclusive reader offers and signed editions, GoodBooks.lk is the perfect online companion to our High Street bookshops. Click & Collect � the service that links the two � has grown in tandem with our success, allowing our customers to experience the best of both worlds.

	Through our own range of books, our array of gifts and booksellers who genuinely love what they sell, we welcome you to GoodBooks.</h2></p><br/><br/>


	<p><h1 align="center">Privacy Policy</p></h1><br/>
	<p><h2 align="center">We respect the privacy of every person who visits or registers with GoodBooks.lk or uses the GoodBooks mobile application (the "Sites") or the services that we make available from the Sites, over the telephone or in our shops, including but not limited to our customer support service, free in-store wi-fi service and loyalty schemes (our "Services"). We are further committed to ensuring a safe online experience.</p></h2><br/><br/>
	
	<p><h1 align="center">Terms And Conditions</h1><p><br/>
	<p><h2 align="center">In some circumstances, we may place a limit on the number of copies of a particular book or product, or series of books or products, that you can order. This may, for example, be where we have limited stocks of a particular book or product, whether caused by limitations placed on us by our suppliers, where a book is signed by an author or otherwise. Where we are aware of this, we will notify you prior to an order being made. Whether or not we have notified you before you have placed an order, if GoodBooks has insufficient stock to deliver some or all of the goods ordered by you, or where you have ordered or sought to order (whether in one transaction or multiple transactions, and whether from one or more customer accounts) goods in excess of any quantity limits we have imposed, we will notify you as soon as possible of which parts of your order we will accept and which we will reject. Sums debited (if any) by Waterstones from your debit or credit card, or from any other source of payment in respect of goods we are unable or unwilling to supply to you will be re-credited to your account and GoodBooks will notify you by email at the address given by you in your order form of which orders have been satisfied and which have been rejected. Any refund will be made as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of your order. GoodBooks will not be obliged to offer any additional compensation for disappointment suffered.</p></h2><br/><br/>
